5. Temperature/thermal

wellsca@cb0:~$ sudo /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp
temp=51.6'C
wellsca@cb0:~$

 Load CAN-bus (seeed stuff)
  [rpi] echo >>/boot/config.txt 'dtoverlay=seeed-can-fd-hat-v2'
  [rpi] reboot
  [rpi] ip link show
  [rpi] ifconfig -a
  [rpi] sudo apt install can-utils
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set can1 type can bitrate 500000
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set up can0
  [rpi-X] sudo ip link set up can1
  [rpi-1] candump can0
  [rpi-0] cansend can0 123#1122334455667788
